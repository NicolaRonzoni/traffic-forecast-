The repository contains the code for clustering and prediction of Minnesota data: I-35 north bound direction to Minneapolis. 

To have a better overview of the tools used see:
- https://tslearn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

To run the code .py the following step are necessary:

Have installed python3.
Having access to Spyder  from Anaconda or from Colab.
The code uses the following libraries:
- math;
- scipy;
- pandas;
- numpy;
- toolz;
- random;
- tslearn; 
- sklearn;
- matplotlib.
(use the pip install command if needed)

The code is organized in the following sheets:
- "function" contains all the functions; 
- "main" contains the derivation of multivariate time series, the clustering results and visualization, centroid representation;
- "prediction loops and ramps" contains one step and multistep predictions;
- "prediction loops" contains one step and multistep predictions, evaluations of the predictions and visualization.
